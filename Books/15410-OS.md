## Exception
* [CPU-Int-Table](https://wiki.osdev.org/Exceptions)
* trap (int 3 / OxCC): ++EIP
> Traps are reported immediately after the execution of the trapping instruction. A trap is an exception that is reported immediately following the execution of the trapping instruction. Traps allow execution of a program or task to be continued without loss of program continuity. The return address for the trap handler points to the instruction to be executed after the trapping instruction.
* + [Windows-consider-INT3-single-byte-and-decrement-EIP-by-1](http://www.triplefault.io/2017/08/detecting-debuggers-by-abusing-bad.html)
* fault: EIP sames
> These can be corrected and the program may continue as if nothing happened. A fault is an exception that can generally be corrected and that, once corrected, allows the program to be restarted with no loss of continuity. When a fault is reported, the processor restores the machine state to the state prior to the beginning of execution of the faulting instruction. The return address (saved contents of the CS and EIP registers) for the fault handler points to the faulting instruction, rather than to the instruction following the faulting instruction.
* abort
> Some severe unrecoverable error.
* interrupt (programmable, syscall 0x80)
> Interrupts occur at random times during the execution of a program, in response to signals from hardware. System hardware uses interrupts to handle events external to the processor, such as requests to service peripheral devices. Software can also generate interrupts by executing the INT n instruction.

```c++
boolean want[2] = {false, false};
int turn = 0;

want[i] = true;
turn = j;
while (want[j] && turn == j)
    continue;
...critical section...
want[i] = false;

Assume contrary: two threads in critical section
Both in c.s. implies want[i] == want[j] == true
Thus both while loops exited because “turn != j”
Cannot have (turn == 0 && turn == 1)
     So one exited frst
w.l.o.g., T0 exited frst because “turn ==1” failed
     So turn==0 before turn==1
     So T1 had to set turn==0 before T0 set turn==1
     So T0 could not see turn==0, could not exit loop frst!

## Boot
* Ground 0
* + real mode
* + 0xFFFF0 (jump to actual BIOS entry point)
* BIOS
* + Code in read-only memory (EPROM=>EEPROM=>Flash)
* + configure hardware details
* + - RAM refersh rate / bus speed
* + - password

* + load OS
* + provides some device drivers
* + POST (power on self test)
* + - scan for crticial resources
* + - - RAM/Graphics card/Disk/Keyboard
* + Boot-Device search
```
Consult saved settings for selected order
- “A: C: G:” (maybe PXE)
Load the first sector from a boot device
- Could be a floppy, hard disk, CDROM
- Without a BIOS, we’d be in a bit of a jam If the last two bytes are AA55, we’re set
Otherwise look somewhere else
- If no luck, strike terror into user's heart:
- “No Operating System Present
```
* + Boot-Sector Launch
```
Boot sector is copied to 0x7C00
Execution is transferred to 0x7C00
Extra step for hard disk or CD-ROM
    • Boot sector (“MBR”) knows about partitions
        • BIOS starts it running at 0x7C00, of course
        • Copies itself elsewhere in memory, jumps there
        • Loads “active” partition's boot sector at 0x7C00
Now we’re executing the boot loader – the first “software” to execute on the PC
```
* Boot Loader
* + GRUB
* + load OS from /boot/kernel.gz
* + - need to understand file system
* + Multi-stage boot loader
* + - BIOS => First sector => Load rest of boot loader => boot menu => switching mode for OS > 1MB => Load done => jump to kernel entry point

Receive rights
 “Receive end” of a port
 Held by one task, not published
 receive rights imply ownership
Send rights
 “Send end” - ability to transmit message to mailbox
 Frequently published via “name server” task
 Confer no rights (beyond “denial of service”)
Memory regions
 In-line for “small” messages (copied)
 Out-of-line for “large” messages
 Sender may de-allocate on send
 Otherwise, copy-on-write
“Port rights”
 Sender specifes task-local port #
 OS translates to internal port-id while queued
 Receiver observes task-local port 
send
 block, block(n milliseconds), don't-block
 “send just one”
 when destination full, queue 1 message in sender thread
 sender notifed when transfer completes
receive
 receive from port
 receive from port set
 block, block(n milliseconds), don't-block
Port send rights are OS-managed capabilities
 unguessable, unforgeable
How to contact a server?
 Ask the name server task
 Trusted – source of all capabilities
How to contact the name server?
 Task creator specifes name server for new task
 Can create custom environment for task tree
» By convention, send rights to name server are located a
a particular client port number (like stdin/stdout/stderr)
 System boot task launches nameserver, gives out rights

## Storage
* non-volatile
* slow
* block-oriented
* + Ancient times: (C,H,S) tuple
* + - C, H, S were geometric features of old disks
* + Modern: (LBA)
* + - “Logical Block Address” runs from 0..N
* Out of order
* hard drive
* + spindler + platter => surface => tracks => sectors / cylinders
* + zoned bit recording
* + LBA (logical base address)
* seek rate - slow KB/s
* transfer rate - quick MB/s
* SSD (solid state disk)
* + RAM backed by a battery
* + - fast
* + NOR flash
* + - word-accessible / write-slow desnity-low
* + NAND flash
* + - rw pages(512B) / erase blocks(16KB)
* + - write amplication
* + - - copy => write RAM => erase => write back
* + - wear leveling
* + - - transparently re-map host address onto NAND address
* + - - group multiple small writes
* + - - update disk block => store new copy
* + - - FTL (flash translation layer)
* + - - Over-provision (advertise less space than reality)
```
No moving parts means no “seek time” / “rotational delay”
Read is faster than write
Write and “erase” are different
     A blank page can be written to (once)
     A written page must be erased before rewriting
     But pages can't be individually erased!
         “Erase” works on multi-page blocks (16 KB)
         “Erase” is very slow
         “Erase” damages the block each time

Characteristics
 Word addressable (small random accesses are fast)
 Slower than RAM, faster than NAND ﬂash
 Less power than RAM, more power than NAND ﬂash
 Doesn't have write amplifcation
 Wear is less of a threat
 Price is a multiple of NAND ﬂash
Initially packaged as “Optane” SSD
Expected to be packaged later as DIMMs
 Exact usage model unclear

SSD vs. disk
☺ SSD's implement “regular disk” model
    LBA sectors
    Write-sector, read-sector, “park heads”, etc.
☺ Read operations are extremely fast (100X faster), no “seek
time” or “rotational delay” (every sector is “nearby”)
? Write operations “vary widely” (maybe 100X faster, maybe
not faster at all)
☺ SSD's use less power than actual disks (~1/5?)
☺ SSD's are shock-resistant
☹ Writing to an SSD wears it out much faster than a disk
☹ SSD's are expensive (20X or more)
