[Spring2017](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2017/)



## Why Parallelism? Why Efficiency

* Common definition: A parallel computer is a collection of processing elements that cooperate to solve problems quickly

* `speedup (P processor) = execution T (1 processor) / execution T (p processor)`

  * limited by communication -> improve locality
  * limited by imbalance in work assignment -> improve distribution of work

* Design & Write scale parallel programs

  * decomposing works in pieces which can performed in parallel
  * assign work to processors
  * managing communication/synchronization

* Parallel computer hardware implementation

  * performance characteristics
  * trade-off

* Efficiency

* Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP)

  * superscalar execution

  * > Most available ILP is exploited by a processor capable of issuing four instructions per clock

* Power wall

  * dynamic power $\propto$ capacitive load $\times$ voltage$^2$ $\times$ frequency
  * static power: transistors burn power even when inactive due to leakage

* Single-core performance scaling

  * frequency limited by power
  * ILP scaling tapped out
  * -> adding more execution units that run in parallel



## A Modern Multi-Core Processor

* ![1567760198111](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567760198111.png)
* Multi-core
  * increase cores instead of adding processor logic using transistors
    * `pthread`s
  * amortize cost/complexity of managing an instruction stream across many ALUs
    * SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) processing
      * SSE instructions: 128-bit operations: 4x32 bits or 2x64 bits (4-wide foat vectors)
      * AVX256 instructions: 256 bit operations: 8x32 bits or 4x64 bits (8-wide foat vectors)
      * AVX512 instruction: 512 bit operations: 16x32 bits
      * generated by compiler
        * intrinsics
        * conveyed using parallel language semantics (E.g. OpenMP)
        * inferred by dependency analysis of loops (`-march=native`)
      * explicit SIMD: compile time SIMD (`vstoreps`, `vmulps`, ...)
      * implicit SIMD: scalar binary -> N instances of program together on the processor
        * interface to the hardware itself is data-parallel
        * hardware simultaneously executing the same instruction from multiple instances on different data on SIMD ALUs
    * conditional code
      * ![1567776572920](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567776572920.png)
      * instruction stream coherence (coherent execution): Same instruction sequence applies to all elements operated upon simultaneously
      * divergent execution: can't efficiently use of SIMD processing
* Parallel execution forms
  * Multi-core: use multiple processing cores
    * Provides thread-level parallelism (TLP): simultaneously execute a completely different instruction stream on each core 
    * Software decides when to create threads (e.g., via pthreads API)
  * SIMD: use multiple ALUs controlled by same instruction stream (within a core)
    * Efficient design for data-parallel workloads: control amortized over many ALUs 
    * Vectorization can be done by compiler (explicit SIMD) or at runtime by hardware
    * [Lack of] dependencies is known prior to execution (usually declared by programmer, but can be inferred by loop analysis by advanced compiler)
  * Superscalar: exploit ILP within an instruction stream. Process different instructions from the same instruction stream in parallel (within a core)
    * Parallelism automatically and dynamically discovered by the hardware during execution (not programmer visible)
* Memory latency: The amount of time for a memory request (e.g., load, store) from a processor to be serviced by the memory system
* Memory bandwidth: The rate at which the memory system can provide data to a processor
* Stall: A processor “stalls” when it cannot run the next instruction in an instruction stream because of a dependency on a previous instruction
  * Caches reduce length of stalls (reduce latency, memory access)
  * Prefetching reduces stalls (hide latency) [[Check stride prefetcher]]
  * Multi-threading reduces stalls (hide latency) (Interleave processing of multiple threads)
* Storing execution contexts
  * Many small contexts (high latency hiding ability)
  * Few large contexts (low latency hiding ability)
* Hardware-supported multi-threading
  * Core manages execution contexts for multiple threads
    * Runs instructions from runnable threads (processor makes decision about which thread to run each clock, not the operating system) 
    * Core still has the same number of ALU resources: multi-threading only helps use them more efficiently in the face of high-latency operations like memory access
  * Interleaved multi-threading (a.k.a. temporal multi-threading) [[Check: fine/coarse-grained HT]]
    * each clock, the core chooses a thread, and runs an instruction from the thread on the ALUs
    * ![1567777877065](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567777877065.png)
    * ![1567777915308](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567777915308.png)
  * Simultaneous multi-threading (SMT)
    * Each clock, core chooses instructions from multiple threads to run on ALUs
    * Extension of superscalar (OoO?) CPU
    * ![1567777926455](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567777926455.png)
  * ![1567777949770](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567777949770.png)
  * ![1567777966921](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567777966921.png)
  * Use core's FU resources more efficiently
  * Cost
    * Requires additional storage for thread contexts (duplicated register, RAT)
    * Increases run time of any single thread
    * Requires additional independent work in a program
    * Relies heavily on memory bandwidth
      * larger working set -> less cache space per thread (often shared)
      * [[Check: SMT helper thread prefetching]]
* GPU: extreme throughput-oriented processors
  * warp: instruction streams (32 pieces of data per time, thread issuing 32-wide vector instruction)
  * different instructions from up to 4 warps executed simultaneously (SMT)
  * 64 warps interleaved on the SM (interleaved MT with thread context)
  * ![1567777529692](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567777529692.png)
  * ![1567777551536](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567777551536.png)
* Bandwidth bound
  * Organize computation to fetch data from memory less often
    * Reuse data previously loaded by the same thread (intra-thread temporal locality optimization) cache
    * Share data across threads (inter-thread cooperation) `__shared__`
  * Request data less often
    * arithmetic intensity:  ratio of math operations to data access operations in an instruction stream



## Parallel Programming Abstraction

* [ISPC](http://ispc.github.io/): Intel SPMD Program Compiler

  * `programCount`:  number of simultaneously executing instances in the gang (uniform value)

  * `programIndex`:  id of the current instance in the gang. (a non-uniform value: “varying”)

  * `uniform`: A type modifer. All instances have the same value for this variable. Its use is purely an optimization. Not needed for correctness.

  * Interleaved assignment of program instances to loop iterations

    * ```c++
      export	void	sinx(	
      			uniform	int	N,	
      			uniform	int	terms,	
      			uniform	float*	x,	
      			uniform	float*	result)	
      {	
      			//	assumes	N	%	programCount	=	0	
      			for	(uniform	int	i=0;	i<N;	i+=programCount)
      			{	
      				int	idx	=	i	+	programIndex;	
      				float	value	=	x[idx];	
      				float	numer	=	x[idx]	*	x[idx]	*	x[idx];	
      				uniform	int	denom	=	6;		//	3!	
      				uniform	int	sign	=	-1;	
      				for	(uniform	int	j=1;	j<=terms;	j++)	
      				{		
      							value	+=	sign	*	numer	/	denom	
      							numer	*=	x[idx]	*	x[idx];	
      							denom	*=	(2*j+2)	*	(2*j+3);	
      							sign	*=	-1;	
      						}	
      						result[idx]	=	value;	
      			}	
      }
      ```

    * ![1567782401194](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567782401194.png)

  * Blocked assignment of program instances to loop iterations

    * ```c++
      export	void	sinx(	
      			uniform	int	N,	
      			uniform	int	terms,	
      			uniform	float*	x,	
      			uniform	float*	result)	
      {	
      			//	assume	N	%	programCount	=	0	
      			uniform	int	count	=	N	/	programCount;	
      			int	start	=	programIndex	*	count;	
      			for	(uniform	int	i=0;	i<count;	i++)
      			{	
      				int	idx	=	start	+	i;	
      				float	value	=	x[idx];	
      				float	numer	=	x[idx]	*	x[idx]	*	x[idx];	
      				uniform	int	denom	=	6;		//	3!	
      				uniform	int	sign	=	-1;	
      				for	(uniform	int	j=1;	j<=terms;	j++)	
      				{		
      							value	+=	sign	*	numer	/	denom	
      							numer	*=	x[idx]	*	x[idx];	
      							denom	*=	(j+3)	*	(j+4);	
      							sign	*=	-1;	
      						}	
      						result[idx]	=	value;	
      			}	
      }
      ```

    * ![1567782412440](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567782412440.png)

    * single packed load SSE (`__mm_load_ps1`) can efficiently implements `float value = x[idx]`

  * Raising level of abstraction

    * `foreach`: declares parallel loop iterations. cooperatively perform a loop in a gang

    * ISPC decides the assignment

    * ```c++
      export	void	sinx(	
      			uniform	int	N,	
      			uniform	int	terms,	
      			uniform	float*	x,	
      			uniform	float*	result)	
      {	
      			foreach	(i	=	0	...	N)	
      			{	
      				float	value	=	x[i];	
      				float	numer	=	x[i]	*	x[i]	*	x[i];	
      				uniform	int	denom	=	6;		//	3!	
      				uniform	int	sign	=	-1;	
      				for	(uniform	int	j=1;	j<=terms;	j++)	
      				{		
      							value	+=	sign	*	numer	/	denom	
      							numer	*=	x[i]	*	x[i];	
      							denom	*=	(2*j+2)	*	(2*j+3);	
      							sign	*=	-1;	
      						}	
      						result[i]	=	value;	
      			}	
      }
      ```

  * abstraction vs implementation

    * SPMD (Single Program, Multiple Data) abstraction:  running a gang is spawning `programCount` logical instruction streams (each with a different value of `programIndex`)
    * SIMD implementation: ISPC compiler emits vector instructions (SSE4 or AVX) that carry out the logic performed by a ISPC gang.
      * handle mapping of conditional control flow to vector insns (by masking vector lanes)

  * assign `varying` variables to `uniform` variable causes compile-time error

* Thread Programming Model

  * ![1567782926364](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567782926364.png)

* ISPC Programming Model

  * ![1567782952350](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567782952350.png)

* Shared address space communication Model

  * Threads communicate by
    * reading/writing to shared variables
    * manipulating synchronization primitives
  * natural extension of sequential programming
  * HW implementation: any processor can directly reference any memory location
    * ![1567783167395](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567783167395.png)
    * Intel/AMD: on-chip network
      * AMD hyper-transport / Intel QuickPath (QPI)
    * UltraSPARC: crossbar (CCX)
    * costly for NUMA & scale
      * SGI Altix: fat tree
  * can be implemented by HW unsupported machines via SW solution (mark all shared pages as invalid, #PF issue network requests)

* Message passing communication Model

  * Threads operate within their own private address spaces
  * Threads communicate by sending/receiving messages
    * `send`: specifies recipient, buffer to be transmitted, and optional message identifier (“tag”)
    * `receive`: sender, specifies buffer to store data, and optional message identifier
  * MPI (Message Passing Interface)
  * HW implementation: may accelerate communicate messages
    * connect commodity systems together to form large parallel machine (clusters)
  * commonly implemented on a shared address space HW (by copying)

* Data parallel communication Model

  * `map(function, collection)`

  * Synchronization is implicit at the end of the `map` (`map` returns when function has been applied to all elements of collection)

  * like `foreach` in ISPC

  * Stream: sequences of elements (can be processed independently)

  * Kernel: side-effect-free functions

  * benefits

    * global-scale program dependencies known by compiler (enables compiler to perform aggressive optimizations that require global program analysis)
    * Independent processing on elements, kernel functions are side-effect free
      * parallelize kernel execution
      * can't be non-deterministic
    * I/O of each invocation known in advance: prefetching hiding latency
    * Producer-consumer dependencies are known in advance: pipelined execution (save bandwidth)

  * drawbacks

    * need library of operators to describe complex data flows

  * `gather/scatter`

    * ```c++
      const	int	N	=	1024;	
      stream<float>	input(N);	
      stream<int>	indices;	
      stream<float>	tmp_input(N);			
      stream<float>	output(N);	
      stream_gather(input,	indices,	tmp_input);
      absolute_value(tmp_input,	output);
      
      export	void	absolute_value(	
      			uniform	float	N,	
      			uniform	float*	input,	
      			uniform	float*	output,	
      			uniform	int*	indices)	
      {	
      			foreach	(i	=	0	...	n)	
      			{	
      						float	tmp	=	input[indices[i]];	
      						if	(tmp	<	0)	
      									output[i]	=	-tmp;	
      						else	
      									output[i]	=	tmp;	
      			}	
      }
      ```

    * ```c++
      const	int	N	=	1024;	
      stream<float>	input(N);	
      stream<int>	indices;	
      stream<float>	tmp_output(N);			
      stream<float>	output(N);	
      absolute_value(input,	tmp_output);	
      stream_scatter(tmp_output,	indices,	output);
      
      export	void	absolute_value(	
      			uniform	float	N,	
      			uniform	float*	input,	
      			uniform	float*	output,	
      			uniform	int*	indices)	
      {	
      			foreach	(i	=	0	...	n)	
      			{	
      						if	(input[i]	<	0)	
      									output[indices[i]]	=	-input[i];	
      						else	
      									output[indices[i]]	=	input[i];	
      			}	
      }
      ```

    * ![1567784079027](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567784079027.png)

  * impose rigid program structure to facilitate simple programming and advanced optimization

  * ISPC, OpenCL, CUDA

    * flexibility/familiarity of imperative C-style syntax over the syntax of a more functional form: for adoption

* Mixed programming Model

  * shared address space model within a multi-core node of a cluster + message passing between nodes
  * data-parallel model support shared memory style synchronization primitives in kernels
    * permit limited forms of inter-iteration communications

    * `__shared__`: per block shared memory

    * `__syncthreads()`: barrier, wait for all threads in the block to arrive

    * Each thread block must execute 128 CUDA threads

    * Each thread block requires `130 x sizeof(float) = 520` bytes of shared memory

  * Execution: thread hierarchy

    * thread - warp - thread block - stream multi-processor (SM, core)
    * thread block execution can be carried out in any order
    * dynamic scheduling

  * Distributed address space

    * built-in memcpy primitives between host & device
    * per thread / per block (`__shared__`) / per program (`__global__`) / constant memory (`__constant__`)

  * ![1567838366477](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567838366477.png)

  * SM core operation each clock

    * Select up to four runnable warps from 64 resident on SM core (thread-level parallelism)
    * Select up to two runnable instructions per warp (instruction-level parallelism)

  * Warp: CUDA implementation detail

    * On modern NVIDIA hardware, groups of 32 CUDA threads in a thread block are executed simultaneously using 32-wide SIMD execution
      * share same instruction stream
    * The group of 32 threads sharing an instruction stream is called a warp

  * Running the CUDA kernel

    * Step 1: host sends CUDA device (GPU) a command (“execute this kernel”)
    * Step 2: scheduler maps block 0 to core 0 (reserves execution contexts for 128 threads and 520 bytes of shared storage) 
    * Step 3: scheduler continues to map blocks to available execution contexts
    * Step 4: core completes block, reschedule

    > GTX 1080 SM combines the ideas of interleaved multi-threading, simultaneous multi-threading, SIMD execution, and super-scalar execution in the following manner :
    >
    > 1. Interleaved Multi-threading : Since up-to-64 warps could be active at anytime, multiple threads could be interleaved depending on which 4 warps are chosen each time.
    > 2. Simultaneous multi-threading : Each SM has four warp selectors. Each warp selector can choose to issue instructions from different threads.
    > 3. SIMD Execution : There are SIMD functional units in each SM that helps do SIMD operations.
    > 4. Super-scalar Execution : During each cycle, the warp selector can issue up to 2 instructions to be executed, supporting super scalar execution.

    > - But only 4*32=1028 CUDA threads are executed simultaneously.
    > - Groups of 32 CUDA threads share an instruction stream. (and are executed in a SIMD manner)
    > - The SM may choose to execute 2 instructions from a CUDA thread at once when an appropriate mixture is available. (And of course each of those two instructions are executed in a SIMD manner as described above.)

## Performance Optimization I: Work Distribution & Scheduling

* Balancing the workload

  * low computational & synchronization overhead
  * Static assignment: pre-determined (compile-time, may runtime)
    * when cost & amount of work is predictable
  * Semi-static assignment: periodically profile & re-adjust
    * cost of work is predictable for near-term future
    * ![1567841768892](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567841768892.png)
  * Dynamic assignment: runtime
    * work queue: tasks - shared work queue - worker threads
    * choosing task granularity
      * Useful to have many more tasks* than processors (many small tasks enables good workload balance via dynamic assignment) 
        * small granularity
      * Want as few tasks as possible to minimize overhead of managing the assignment
        * large granularity
    * task scheduling
      * multiple-queue with steal work
      * task dependency managed by scheduler

* Common parallel programming patterns

  * data parallelism

    * ```c++
      //	ISPC	foreach	
      foreach	(i=0	...	N)	{	
      			B[i]	=	foo(A[i]);	
      }
      //	ISPC	bulk	task	launch	
      launch[numTasks]	myFooTask(A,	B);
      
      //	bulk	CUDA	thread	launch	
      foo<<<numBlocks,	threadsPerBlock>>>(A,	B);
      
      //	using	higher-order	function	‘map’	
      map(foo,	A,	B);
      
      //	openMP	parallel	for	
      #pragma	omp	parallel	for	
      for	(int	i=0;	i<N;	i++)	{	
      			B[i]	=	foo(A[i]);	
      }	
      ```

  * explicit management via threads

    * fork/join pattern - divide & conquer

      * Cilk Plus

        * `cilk_spawn foo(args)`:  invoke foo, but unlike standard function call, caller may continue executing asynchronously with execution of foo
          * hide implementation, like `std::async`
          * run continuation first (child stealing): Caller thread spawns work for all iterations before executing any of it (BFS)
          * run child first (continuation stealing): Caller thread only creates one item to steal (continuation that represents all remaining iterations) (DFS)

      * `cilk_sync`: returns when all calls spawned by current function have completed. (“sync up” with the spawned calls)

        * stall join
        * greedy policy: When thread that initiates the fork goes idle, it looks to steal new work. Last thread to reach the join point continues execution after sync
          * All threads always attempt to steal if there is nothing to do (thread only goes idle if no work to steal is present in system)
          * Worker thread that initiated spawn may not be thread that executes logic after `cilk_sync`

      * ```c++
        void	quick_sort(int*	begin,	int*	end)	{	
        		if	(begin	>=	end	-	PARALLEL_CUTOFF)	
        				std::sort(begin,	end);	
        		else	{	
        					int*	middle	=	partition(begin,	end);		
        					cilk_spawn	quick_sort(begin,	middle);	
        					quick_sort(middle+1,	last);	
        		}	
        }
        ```

      * heavyweight spawn?

      * context switching overhead

      * larger working set, less cache locality

      * -> using worker thread pool + work queue per thread

      * work stealing: dequeue per worker

        * steal work from top of dequeue
          * steals largest amount of work
          * maximum locality (combined with run child first)
          * don't contend for same elements of dequeue (nice lock-free SPSC dequeue)





## Performance Optimization II: Locality, Communication & Contention

* Message passing grid solver

  * ```c++
    int	N;	
    int	tid	=	get_thread_id();	
    int	rows_per_thread	=	N	/	get_num_threads();	
    float*	localA	=	allocate(rows_per_thread+2,	N+2);	
    //	assume	localA	is	initialized	with	starting	values

    							my_diff	+=	fabs(localA[i,j]	-	prev);	
    					}	
    		}	
    		if	(tid	!=	0)	{	
    					send(&mydiff,	sizeof(float),	0,	MSG_ID_DIFF);	
    					recv(&done,	sizeof(bool),	0,	MSG_ID_DONE);	
    		}	else	{	
    					float	remote_diff;	
    					for	(int	i=1;	i<get_num_threads()-1;	i++)	{	
    								recv(&remote_diff,	sizeof(float),	i,	MSG_ID_DIFF);	
    								my_diff	+=	remote_diff;	
    					}	
    					if	(my_diff/(N*N)	<	TOLERANCE)	
    							done	=	true;	
    					for	(int	i=1;	i<get_num_threads()-1;	i++)	
    							send(&done,	sizeof(bool),	i,	MSD_ID_DONE);	
    		}		
    	}	
    }
    ```

  * synchronous & blocking -> deadlock!

    * `send()`: call returns when sender receives acknowledgement that message data resides in address space of receiver
    * `recv()`: call returns when data from received message is copied into address space of receiver and acknowledgement sent back to sender

  * asynchronous & non-blocking

    * `send()`: call returns immediately, buffer provided to send() cannot be modifed by calling thread since message processing occurs concurrently with thread execution
    * `recv()`: posts intent to receive in the future, returns immediately. Use `checksend()`, `checkrecv()` to determine actual status of send/receipt

* Pipelining

  * ![1567863651166](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567863651166.png)

* Communication as extended memory hierarchy

  * inherent communication:  must occur in a parallel algorithm
    * good assignment decision
    * ![1567864610403](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567864610403.png)
  * artifactual communication: all other communication (from practical details of system)
    * minimum data transfer granularity
      * ![1567865186752](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567865186752.png)
    * unnecessary comm by OS (like cache line block)
    * poor placement of data in distributed memory (reside far away)
    * finite replication capacity
  * `comm-to-comp ratio = 1 / arith intensity = comm / comp`
  * Cache miss
    * Cold miss: First time data touched. Unavoidable in a sequential program
    * Capacity miss: Working set is larger than cache. Can be avoided/reduced by increasing cache size
    * Conflict miss: Miss induced by cache management policy. Can be avoided/reduced by changing cache associativity, or data access pattern in application
    * Communication miss: Due to inherent or artifactual communication in parallel system
  * Reduce communication
    * temporal locality
      * blocked iteration order (avoid cache ping-pong)
        * ![1567864983294](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567864983294.png)
      * fusing loops
        * combine multiple loops to reduce I/O
        * may cause conflict miss
        * may use FMAoperation
      * sharing data
        * co-locate tasks operating same data
        * E.g. CUDA thread block
    * spatial locality
      * granularity of data transfer
        * blocked data layout
          * ![1567865232418](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567865232418.png)
          * E.g. im2col, [CSR/CSC (compact sparse row/col)](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/37525925)
      * granularity of cache coherence
    * Reduce overhead of communication to sender/receiver
      * coalescing small messages
    * Reduce latency of communication
      * restructure code (SW), improve arch (HW)
    * Reduce contention
      * Replicate contended resources (e.g., local copies, fne-grained locks)
      * Stagger access to contended resources
    * Increase communication/computation overlap
      * Application writer: use asynchronous communication (e.g., async messages)
      * HW implementer: pipelining, multi-threading, pre-fetching, out-of-order exec

* Contention

  * memory contention in CUDA

  * ![1567865507724](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567865507724.png)

  * ```c++
    __shared__	float	A[512];	
    int	index	=	threadIdx.x;	
    float	x2	=	A[index];						//	single	cycle	
    float	x3	=	A[3*index];				//	single	cycle	
    float	x4	=	A[16	*	index];	//	16	cycles
    ```

  * > The first 2 only take one clock cycle because each of the indices fall on a different bank of the shared memory so you can instantly read the value. However, the last one has half of them in one bank and half in another, so you have to read from two banks 16 times each to get the 32 values you want since you can only read one value per clock.

  * ![1567865673388](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567865673388.png)

    * why power of 2 sometimes is not good: 1. cache associative 2. memory bank contention

  * N-body: particles within cells in a grid

    * parallelize by cell (insufficient parallelism)
    * parallelize over particles (massive contention for single shared data)
    * finer-granularity locks (lock per cell)
    * partial results + merge (extra work/memory footprint)
    * data-parallel 
      * Step 1: compute cell containing each particle (parallel over input particles)
      * Step 2: sort results by cell (particle index array permuted based on sort)
      * Step 3: fnd start/end of each cell (parallel over particle_index elements)





## Parallel Application Case Studies

  * ![1567927542501](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567927542501.png)
  * Decomposition: Spatial partitioning of grid: each processor receives 2D tile of grid
  * Assignment: Static assignment of tiles to processors
  * Synchronization: Barriers (separate each pass over grid is a different phase of computation) + Locks for mutual exclusion when updating shared variables (atomic update of ‘diff’)
  * Working Set
    * Local neighborhood for cell 
    * Three rows of a processor’s local partition of grid
    * Processor’s local partition of grid
  * Observation
    * Static assignment is sufficient (approximately equal busy time per thread)
    * 4D blocking (block-major) of grid reduces time spent on communication
    * Synchronization cost is largely due to waiting at barriers

## Snooping-Based Cache Coherence

* cache coherence: Reading a value at address X should return the last value written to address X by any processor

  * device I/O via direct memory access (DMA) -> mark page table uncachable [[Check: what every programmer should know about memory]]

* memory coherence:  both global storage (main memory) and per-processor local storage (processor caches) implementing the abstraction of a single shared address space

  * for each memory location, there is a hypothetical serial order of all program operations (executed by all processors) to the location that is consistent with the results of execution
  * Memory operations issued by any one processor occur in the order issued by the processor
  * The value returned by a read is the value written by the last write to the location as given by the serial order
  * A memory system is coherent if
    * A read by processor P to address X that follows a write by P to address X, should return the value of the write by P (assuming no other processor wrote to X in between)
      * obey program order
    * A read by processor P1 to address X that follows a write by processor P2 to X returns the written value... if the read and write are “sufficiently separated” in time (assuming no other write to X occurs in between)
      * "write propagation": eventually consistency
    * Writes to the same address are serialized: two writes to address X by any two processors are observed in the same order by all processors. (Example: if values 1 and then 2 are written to address X, no processor observes X having value 2 before value 1)
      * "write serialization": Writes to the same location are serialized: two writes to address X by any two processors are observed in the same order by all processors.
  * Implementation
    * Software: #PF to propagate -> clusters of workstations
    * Hardware: snooping/directory-based

  * write-back invalidation

    * A line in the “exclusive” state can be modifed without notifying the other caches
    * Processor can only write to lines in the exclusive state

      * ![1567957882271](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567957882271.png)
      * Write propagation: Achieved via combination of invalidation on BusRdX, and fush from M-state on subsequent BusRd/BusRdX from another processors
      * Write serialization
        * Writes that appear on interconnect are ordered by the order they appear on interconnect (BusRdX)
        * Reads that appear on interconnect are ordered by order they appear on interconnect (BusRd)
        * Writes that don’t appear on the interconnect (PrWr to line already in M state)
          * Sequence of writes to line comes between two interconnect transactions for the line
          * All writes in sequence performed by same processor, P (that processor certainly observes them in correct sequential order)
          * All other processors observe notifcation of these writes only after a interconnect transaction for the line. So all the writes come before the transaction
          * -> all processors see writes in the same order
    * MESI: optimize reading-then-writing (I ->(BusRd) S ->(BusRdX) M)
      * add "exclusive clean" E (not-modified, but exclusive)

      * complex, for clusters
    * MOESI: AMD Opteron 5-stage
      * In MESI protocol, transition from M to S requires fush to memory
      * Instead transition from M to O (O=”owned, but not exclusive”) and do not fush to memory
      * Other processors maintain shared line in S state, one processor maintains line in O state
      * Data in memory is stale, so cache with line in O state must service cache misses

      * Exclusive-clean (E): only one cache has line, memory up-to-date

      * Shared-clean (SC): multiple caches may have line, and memory may or may not ** be up to date

      * Shared-modifed (SM): multiple caches may have line, memory not up to date

        * Only one cache can be in this state for a given line (but others can be in SC)
        * Cache with line in SM state is “owner” of data. Must update memory upon eviction

      * Modifed (M): only one cache has line, it is dirty, memory is not up to date

        * Cache is owner of data. Must update memory upon replacement

      * > no point in time any processor will have an invalid value

    * low miss rate

    * suffer from high traffic due to multiple writes before the next read by another processor

* Inclusion

  * All lines in closer [to processor] cache are also in farther [from processor] cache
  * If line is in owned state (M in MSI/MESI) in L1, it must also be in owned state in L2
  * When line X is invalidated in L2 cache due to BusRdX from another cache, must also invalidate line X in L1
    * each L2 line contains an additional state bit indicating if line data in L1
    * propagation
  * Assume L1 is a write-back cache. Processor writes to line X. (L1 write hit) . Line X in L2 cache is in modifed state in the coherence protocol, but it has stale data. When coherence protocol requires X to be fushed from L2 (e.g., another processor loads X), L2 cache must request the data
    from L1. 
    * each L2 line contains an additional state bit ("modified-but-stale")
    * flushing requires getting from L1 first
  * GPU: write-through, no coherence

* False sharing: Condition where two processors write to different addresses, but addresses map to the same cache line

  * Cache line “ping-pongs” between caches of writing processors, generating signifcant amounts of communication due to the coherence protocol [[Note: true sharing could also lead this]]
  * [Are cache-line-ping-pong and false sharing the same?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30684974/are-cache-line-ping-pong-and-false-sharing-the-same)

* abstraction of a single shared address space is not implementation by a single storage unit



## Directory-Based Cache Coherence

    * simple to build
    * root can be a bottleneck
    * longer latency
    * can't apply to more general network topologies

  * directories:  storing information about the status of the line in one place: a “directory” (centralized)

    * point-2-point messages instead of broadcast

    * ![1567993462363](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1567993462363.png)

      * storage overhead: $O(PM)$
      * increase cache line size (decrease $M$)
      * group multiple processors into a single directory "node" (reduce $P$)
        * hierarchical: use snooping among processors in a node, directory across nodes
      * limited pointer schemes: storage for a limited number of pointers per directory entry should be sufficient (only need a list of the nodes holding a valid copy of the line!)
        * overflow
          * fallback to broadcast
          * just don't allow
          * coarse vector fallback
      * sparse directories
        * Directory at home node maintains pointer to only one node caching line (not a list of sharers)
        * Pointer to next node in list is stored as extra information in the cache line (just like the line’s tag, dirty bits, etc)
        * On read miss: add requesting node to head of list
        * On write miss: propagate invalidations along list
        * On evict: need to patch up list (linked list removal)
        * Low memory storage overhead, additional directory storage is proportional to cache size, traffic on write is proportional to # of sharers
        * Latency of write is proportional to # of sharers, hard to implmenet

      * home node: node with memory holding the corresponding data for the line

      * read miss

        * read miss message sent to home node of the requested line
        * home directory checks entry for line
          * dirty bit OFF: respond with contents from memory, set presence[home] (line is cached by processor home)
          * dirty bit ON: data must be sourced by another processor
            * home node responds with message providing identity of line owner
            * requesting node requests data from owner
            * owner change state to SHARED, respond to request node
            * owner also responds to home node, home clear dirty, update presence bits, updates memory

        * > iterative DNS -> recursive DNS

      * Access pattern

        * “Mostly-read” objects: lots of sharers but writes are infrequent, so communicating with all of them on a write has minimal impact on performance (e.g., root node in Barnes-Hut)
        * Migratory objects (one processor reads/writes for while, then another, etc.): very few sharers, count does not scale with number of processors 
        * Frequently read/written objects: frequent invalidations, but sharer count is low because count cannot build up in short time between invalidations (e.g, shared task queue)
        * Low-contention locks: infrequent invalidations, so no performance problem
        * High-contention locks: can be a challenge, because many readers present when lock released

## A Basic Snooping-Based Multi-Processor Implementation

* Deadlock: Deadlock is a state where a system has outstanding operations to complete, but
  no operation can make progress
  * Mutual exclusion: only one processor can hold a given resource at once
  * Hold and wait: processor must hold the resource while waiting for other resources needed to complete an operation 
  * No preemption: processors don’t give up resources until operation they wish to perform is complete 
  * Circular wait: waiting processors have mutual dependencies (a cycle exists in the resource dependency graph)
* Livelock: Livelock is a state where a system is executing many operations, but no thread is making meaningful progress
* Starvation: State where a system is making overall progress, but some processes make no progress
* Transaction on an atomic bus -> abstraction, actually non-atomic
  * Client is granted bus access (result of arbitration)
  * Client places command on bus (may also place data on bus)
  * Response to command by another bus client placed on bus
  * Next client obtains bus access (arbitration)
* Multi-processor cache controller -> implementation
  * contention: requests from both processor & bus
    * cache duplicate tags
    * multi-ported tag memory
    * tags must sync -> update blocking

    * Shared: OR of result from all results

    * Memory controller could immediately start accessing DRAM, but not respond (squelch response) if a snoop result from another cache indicates it has copy of most recent data
    * Memory could assume one of the caches will service request until snoop results are valid (if snoop indicates no cache has data, then memory must respond)

    * place `BusRdX` on bus / other processor snoop requests
    * memory responds with data for cache line containing `X`

* Split-transaction bus
  * request + response
  * How to match requests with responses?
  * How to handle conficting requests on bus?
  * Flow control: how many requests can be outstanding at a time, and what should be done when buffers fll up?
  * When are snoop results reported? During the request? or during the response?
  * basic design
    * up to 8 outstanding requests (system wide)
    * responses can be reordered requests
    * flow control -> NACKs
    * initialize a request
      * request bus: cmd + address
      * response bus: data + tag
      * Step 1: Requestor asks for request bus access
      * Step 2: Bus arbiter grants access, assigns transaction a tag
      * Step 3: Requestor places command + address on the request bus

        * [[Check: MSHR]]
    * read miss
      * phase 1
        * Request arbitation: cache controllers present request for address to bus (many caches may be doing so in the same cycle)
        * Request resolution: address bus arbiter grants access to one of the requestors. Request table entry allocated for request
        * Caches perform snoop: look up tags, update cache state, etc. (memory operation commits)
        * Caches acknowledge this snoop result is ready (or signal they could not complete snoop in time here (e.g., raise inhibit wire)

  * Cache lookup (tag check)
  * Determine line not in cache (need to generate BusRdX)
  * Arbitrate for bus
  * Win bus, place address, command on bus
  * All caches perform snoop (e.g., invalidate their local copies of the relevant line)
  * Another cache or memory decides it must respond (let’s assume it’s memory)
  * Memory request sent to memory controller 
  * Memory controller is itself a scheduler
  * Memory controller checks active row in DRAM row buffer. (May need to activate new DRAM row. Let’s assume it does.)
  * DRAM reads values into row buffer
  * Memory arbitrates for data bus
  * Memory wins bus
  * Memory puts data on bus
  * Requesting cache grabs data, updates cache line and tags, moves line into exclusive state
  * Processor is notifed data exists
  * Instruction proceeds





## Memory Consistency

* **Memory coherence** defnes requirements for the observed behavior of reads and writes to the *same* memory location

  * The goal of cache coherence is to ensure that the memory system in a parallel computer behaves as if the caches were not there 

* **Memory consistency** defnes the behavior of reads and writes to *different* locations (as observed by other processors)

  * Coherence only guarantees that writes to address X will *eventually* propagate to other processors
  * Consistency deals with *when* writes to X propagate to other processors, relative to reads and writes to other addresses
  * defines the allowed behavior of loads and stores to different addresses in a parallel system

* Memory operation ordering: w.r.t. program order

  * W→R: write to X must commit before subsequent read from Y 
  * R→R: read from X must commit before subsequent read from Y
  * R→W: read to X must commit before subsequent write to Y
  * W→W: write to X must commit before subsequent write to Y

* Sequentially Consistent (SC): all 4 memory operation orderings, serializable R/W

  * A parallel system is sequentially consistent if the result of any parallel execution is the same as if all the memory operations were executed in some sequential order, and the memory operations of any one processor are executed in program order.
  * program order
  * atomicity: all processors see operations equally

* Relaxing order

  * hiding latency: overlap memory access operations with other operations when they are independent.

  * sufficient logical order != program order

  * write buffering (store queue with store-to-load forwarding)

    * relax W→R

  * Total store ordering (TSO): Intel

    * relax W→R
    * Processor P can read B before its write to A is seen by all processors (processor can move its own reads in front of its own writes) (relax program order)
    * Reads by other processors cannot return new value of A until the write to A is observed by all processors (relax atomicity)

  * Eventual consistency guarantees that if there are no other updates to X, A’s update will eventually be observed by all other nodes in the system (note: no guarantees on when, so updates to objects X and Y might propagate to different clients differently)

* Routing: how a message gets from its source to its destination in the network
  * static
  * adaptive
* Buffering and fow control
  * Circuit switching sets up a full path (acquires all resources) between sender and receiver prior to sending a message
    * Establish route (reserve links) then send all data for message
    * Higher bandwidth transmission (no per-packet link mgmt overhead)
    * Does incur overhead to set up/tear down path
    * Reserving links can result in low utilization
    * High-granularity resource allocation: : pre-allocate all resources (links across multiple switches) along entire network path for a message (“setup a fow”)
    * Cost
      * Needs setup phase (“probe”) to set up the path (and to tear it down and release the resources when message complete)
      * Lower link utilization. Transmission of two messages cannot share same link (even if some resources on a preallocated path are no longer utilized during a transmission)
    * Benefits
      * No contention during transmission due to preallocation, so no need for buffering
      * Arbitrary message sizes (once path is set up, send data until done)
  * Packet switching makes routing decisions per packet
    * Route each packet individually (possibly over different network links)
    * Opportunity to use link for a packet whenever link is idle
    * Overhead due to dynamic switching logic during transmission
    * No setup/tear down overhead
  * Granularity of communication
    * Message: Unit of transfer between network clients
    * Packet: Unit of transfer for network
      * Header + Payload/Body +Tail
    * Flit (fow control digit): Unit of flow control in the network
  * Contention
    * buffering
    * dropping
    * reroute (deflection)
  * Store-&-Forward (packet-based)
    * Packet copied entirely into network switch before moving to next node 
    * Requires buffering for entire packet in each router
    * High per-packet latency (latency = packet transmission time on link x network distance)
    * ![1568079227297](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568079227297.png)
  * Cut-through flow control (packet-based)
    * Switch starts forwarding data on next link as soon as packet header is received (header determines how much link bandwidth packet requires + where to route)
    * Reduce transmission latency
    * If output link is blocked (cannot transmit head), transmission of tail can continue
      * entire message absorbed into a buffer in a switch -> S&F
    * Requires buffering for entire packet in each router
  * Wormhole flow control (flit-based)

  * New/emerging technologies
    * Die stacking (3D chips)

## Implementing Synchronization

* Acquire method: How a thread attempts to gain access to protected resource

* Waiting algorithm: How a thread waits for access to be granted to shared resource

  * busy waiting (spinning)
  * blocking
  * [When should one use a spinlock instead of mutex?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5869825/when-should-one-use-a-spinlock-instead-of-mutex)

* Release method: How thread enables other threads to gain resource when its work in the synchronized region is complete

* [Coherence & Synchronization](https://my.eng.utah.edu/~cs6810/pres/12-6810-19.pdf)

* Test-and-set based lock

  * `ts R0, mem[addr]`: load `mem[addr]` into `R0`, if `mem[addr]` is 0, set `mem[addr]` to 1 [[Check: consensus number]]

  * ```assembly
    lock:	ts	R0, mem[addr]
    		bnz	R0, lock
    		
    unlock:	st mem[addr], #0
    ```

  * ![1568082324944](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568082324944.png)

  * Bus contention increases amoung of time to transfer lock

  * Bus contention slows down execution of critical sections

  * low latency, high traffic, pool scaling, low storage cost, no provision for fairness

  * > • If every process spins on an exchange, every exchange instruction will attempt a write -> many invalidates and the locked value keeps changing ownership
    >
    > • Hence, each process keeps reading the lock value – a read does not generate coherence traffic and every process spins on its locally cached copy
    >
    > • When the lock owner releases the lock by writing a 0, other copies are invalidated, each spinning process generates a read miss, acquires a new copy, sees the 0, attempts an exchange (requires acquiring the block in exclusive state so the write can happen), first process to acquire the block in exclusive state acquires the lock, others keep spinning

* CAS lock

  * `lock cmpxchg dst, src`

    * ```
      if	(dst	==	EAX)	
      				ZF	=	1	
      				dst	=	src	
      else	
      				ZF	=	0	
      				EAX	=	dst
      ```

* Load-Linked & Store-Conditional Lock

  * ![1568083064863](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568083064863.png)

  * `LDREX` & `STREX`

  * ```assembly
    lockit: LL R2, 0(R1) ; load linked, generates no coherence traffic
     		BNEZ R2, lockit ; not available, keep spinning
     		DADDUI R2, R0, #1 ; put value 1 in R2
     		SC R2, 0(R1) ; store-conditional succeeds if no one
            ; updated the lock since the last LL
     		BEQZ R2, lockit ; confirm that SC succeeded, else keep trying
    ```

  * ![1568083102149](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568083102149.png)

* Test-and-test-and-set lock [[Check: double lock in singleton]]

  * ```c++
    void	Lock(int*	lock)	{	
    		while	(1)	{	
    				while	(*lock	!=	0);				
    				if	(test_and_set(*lock)	==	0)	
    						return;	
    		}	
    }	
    void	Unlock(int*	lock)	{	
    			*lock	=	0;	
    }
    ```

  * ![1568082754664](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568082754664.png)

  * Slightly higher latency than test-and-set in uncontended case

  * Generates much less interconnect traffic

    * One invalidation, per waiting processor, per lock release ($O(P)$ invalidations)
    * This is $O(P^2)$ interconnect traffic if all processors have the lock cached
    * Recall: test-and-set lock generated one invalidation per waiting processor per test

  * More scalable (due to less traffic)

  * Low storage cost

  * Still no provision for fairness

* Test-and-set lock with backoff [[Check: ALOHA with backoff]]

  * ```c++
    void	Lock(volatile	int*	l)	{	
    		int	amount	=	1;	
    		while	(1)	{	
    				if	(test_and_set(*l)	==	0)	
    						return;	
    				delay(amount);	
    				amount	*=	2;	
    		}	
    }
    ```

  * Generates less traffic than test-and-set

  * Same uncontended latency as test-and-set, but potentially higher latency under contention

  * Exponential back-off can cause severe unfairness

* Ticket lock

  * ```c++
    struct	lock	{	
    			int	next_ticket;	
    			int	now_serving;	
    };	
    void	Lock(lock*	l)	{	
    		int	my_ticket	=	atomic_increment(&l->next_ticket);			//	take	a	“ticket”
    		while	(my_ticket	!=	l->now_serving);																	//	wait for number to be called
    }																																								
    void	unlock(lock*	l)	{	
    		l->now_serving++;	
    }
    ```

  * No atomic operation needed to acquire the lock (only a read)

  * only one invalidation per lock release ($O(P)$ interconnect traffic)

* Array-based lock

  * ```c++
    struct	lock	{	
    			padded_int	status[P];				//	padded	to	keep	off	same	cache	line
    			int	head;	
    };	
    int	my_element;	
    void	Lock(lock*	l)	{	
    		my_element	=	atomic_circ_increment(&l->head);				//	assume	circular	increment
    		while	(l->status[my_element]	==	1);	
    }	
    void	unlock(lock*	l)	{
    		l->status[my_element]	=	1;
    		l->status[circ_next(my_element)]	=	0;												//	next()	gives	next	index
    }
    ```

  * $O(1)$ interconnect traffic per release, but lock requires space linear in $O(P)$

  *  the atomic circular increment is a more complex operation (higher overhead)

* Queueing locks

  * the directory controller keeps track of the order in which requests arrived – when the lock is available, it is passed to the next in line (only one process sees the invalidate and update)

* Desired lock

  * Low latency: If lock is free and no other processors are trying to acquire it, a processor should be able to acquire the lock quickly 
  * Low interconnect traffic: If all processors are trying to acquire lock at once, they should acquire the lock in succession with as little traffic as possible
  * Scalability: Latency / traffic should scale reasonably with number of processors
  * Low storage cost
  * Fairness: Avoid starvation or substantial unfairness

* Min by CAS

  * ```c++
    //	atomicCAS:
    //	atomic	compare	and	swap	performs	the	following	logic	atomically	
    int	atomicCAS(int*	addr,	int	compare,	int	val)	{	
    			int	old	=	*addr;	
    			*addr	=	(old	==	compare)	?	val	:	old;	
    			return	old;	
    }
    
    int	atomic_min(int*	addr,	int	x)	{	
    			int	old	=	*addr;
    			int	new	=	min(old,	x);
    			while	(atomicCAS(addr,	old,	new)	!=	old)	{	
    					old	=	*addr;	
    					new	=	min(old,	x);	
    			}
        		return old;
    }
    
    void atomic_incr(int* addr, int x){
       while(1) {
          int old = *addr;
          if (atomicCAS(addr, old, old + x) == old) break;
       }
    }
    ```

* Barrier

  * centralized barrier

    * wait for all processes to leave first barrier, before clearing flag for entry into the second

    * $O(P)$ traffic on interconnect per barrier

      * All threads: $2P$ write transactions to obtain barrier lock and update counter ($O(P)$ traffic assuming lock acquisition is implemented in $O(1)$ manner)
      * Last thread: 2 write transactions to write to the flag and reset the counter ($O(P)$ traffic since there are many sharers of the flag)
      * $P-1$ transactions to read updated flag
      * span (latency) of entire operation is $O(P)$ 

    * ```c++

## Transaction Memory

* Transaction Memory (TM)
  * Memory transaction: An atomic and isolated sequence of memory accesses
  * Atomicity
    * Upon transaction commit, all memory writes in transaction take effect at once
    * On transaction abort, none of the writes appear to take effect (as if transaction never happened)
  * Isolation
    * No other processor can observe writes before transaction commits
  * Serializability
    * Transactions appear to commit in a single serial order 
  * motivations
    * locks prevent concurrency
    * failure atomicity: no manually caught exceptions, just abort. No lost locks when a thread fails
    * composability: no manually lock order, but global intent. Safe & scalable composition
    * easy-to-use
    * performs as well as fine-grained locks (provides R->R)
* TM Implementation
  * Data versioning policy: How does the system manage uncommitted (new) and previously committed (old) versions of data for concurrenttransactions? [[Check: Undo/Redo Log in DB]]
    * eager versioning (undo-log based): Update memory immediately, maintain “undo log” in case of abort [[Check: 2PL]]
      * ![1568108204342](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568108204342.png)
      * fast commit
      * slower aborts, fault tolerance issues [[Check: STEAL policy]]
    * lazy versioning (write-buffer based): Log memory updates in transaction write buffer, fush buffer on commit [[Check: MVCC]]
      * ![1568108230799](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568108230799.png)
      * faster abort
      * slower commits
  * Confict detection policy: how/when does the system determine that two concurrent transactions confict? [[Check: OCC in DB]]
    * Read-set: addresses read during the transaction
    * Write-set: addresses written during the transaction
    * Read-write confict: transaction A reads address X, which was written to by pending (but not yet committed) transaction B (W->R dirty read, R->W unrepeatable read)
    * Write-write confict: transactions A and B are both pending, and both write to address X (W->W)
    * Pessimistic detection [[Check: 2PL]]
      * ![1568108634836](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568108634836.png)
        * write priority
        * need a manager for livelock
      * detect conflicts early (undo less work, turn some aborts to stalls)
      * no forward progress guarantees, more aborts in some cases
      * fine-grained communication (check on each load/store)
      * detection on critical path
    * Optimistic detection: Detect conficts when a transaction attempts to commit
      * ![1568109977839](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568109977839.png)

        * false sharing
      * Machine word granularity
        * minimize false sharing

    * Hardware transaction memory (HTM)
      * data versioning in caches (cache writer buffer or undo log)
        * add new cache line metadata to track read/write set
        * R bit: indicates data read by transaction (set on loads)
        - W bit: indicates data written by transaction (set on stores)
        * R/W bits can be at word or cache-line granularity
        * R/W bits gang-cleared on transaction commit or abort
        * For eager versioning, need a 2nd cache write for undo log

      * conflict detection via cache coherence protocol
        * Observing shared request to W-word is a read-write confict 
        * Observing exclusive (intent to write) request to R-word is a write-read confict
        * Observing exclusive (intent to write) request to W-word is a write-write confict
      * register checkpoint at transaction begin (HW abort)
      * Commit
        * Validate: request RdX access to write set lines (if needed)
        * Commit: gang-reset R and W bits, turns write set data to valid (dirty) data
      * Abort
        * Check: lookup exclusive requests in the read set and write set
        * Abort: invalidate write set, gang-reset R and W bits, restore to register checkpoint
      * Restricted transaction memory (RTM): Intel Haswell
        * `xbegin`, `xend`, `xabort`: tracks read/write set in L1 cache
        * eviction of line in r/w set will cause abort (no guarantee on progress)

      > 1. Maintain the update value in the edge, and finally doing reduce parallel in vertex. 
      > 2. Construct the connectivity graph for each edge and colorizing the edges, thus get edge sets where edges are independent within one set. Both method required some additional cost. The former requires extra storage for each edge, the later requires extra time and storage for the connectivity graph and colorization.

  * High performance
    - Language is constrained to allow compiler to track dependencies
    - Used for locality-aware partitioning (distributed memory implementation)
    - Used for graph coloring to avoid sync (GPU implementation)
    - Compiler chooses different parallelization strategies for different platforms

      - Halide: only a few scheduling primitives
      - Hadoop: map + reduce
    - Allows compiler/runtime to focus on optimizing these primitives
  * #3: good primitives compose

Also, it looks similar to "dropout", an interesting regularization technique for reducing overfitting by dropping out units in a neural network. Regularization during training is definitely different from dropping small weights in the evaluation, but I believe they may have some connections

## Parallel Deep Network Training

* ![1568171528083](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568171528083.png)
* Huge computational expense
  - Must evaluate the network (forward and backward) for millions of training images
  - Must iterate for many iterations of gradient descent
  - Training modern networks on big datasets takes days
* Large memory footprint
  - Must maintain network layer outputs from forward pass
  - Additional memory to store gradients/gradient velocity for each parameter
  - Recall parameters for popular VGG-16 network require ~500 MB of memory (training requires GBs of memory for academic networks)
  - Scaling to larger networks requires partitioning DNN across nodes to keep DNN + intermediates in memory
* Dependencies / Synchronization (not embarrassingly parallel)
  - Each parameter update step depends on previous
  - Many units contribute to same parameter gradients (fine-scale reduction)
  - Different images in mini batch contribute to same parameter gradients

* Parameter Server
  * Training data partitioned among workers
  * Copy of parameters sent to workers
  * Workers independently compute local “subgradients"

* ![1568172238971](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568172238971.png)

* DRAM access latency

  * best case: read from active row: Column Access Time (CAS)

  * worst case: bit line not ready, read from new row: Precharge (PRE) + Row Active (RAS) + Column Access (CAS)

  * > Something else that was not mentioned that was DRAM needs to be refreshed, because capacitors lose charge over time. In particular, data for each row is temporarily latched and rewritten after a certain number of cycles so that it's value is maintained (for instance, a capacitor maintaining a bit value 1 will eventually read a 0 if its charge is not refreshed). RAM that doesn't need to be refreshed is called SRAM (static RAM) which is much more expensive (stores memory in latches which require more capacitors and transistors than DRAM, which has just one capacitor and transistor per bit), and therefore less common (often used in L1 caches, but not main memory).
    >
    > Whenever we read a row from the DRAM into the row buffer, we actually discharged the capacitors corresponding to that row in the DRAM, so when we replace the row that is in the row buffer, we need to charge back the row in the DRAM ( to not lose the information we had in that row). That is why the Precharge (PRE) step is needed.

* DRAM burst mode: amortize latency over larger transfers

  * ![1568172353426](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568172353426.png)

* DRAM banks

  * all banks share same pins

  * banks allow for pipelining of memory requests

    * Precharge/activate rows/send column address to one bank while transferring data from another
    * Achieves high data pin utilization

  * > both bank interleaving and channel interleaving (as is discussed in next slide) are *interleaved memory* design
    >
    > each bank holds different memory
    >
    > it will need (PRE+RAS)/CAS bands to hide the latency of row activation process and fully use the pin. Therefore, increasing band count or having larger CAS both work here
    >
    > Each DRAM bank has one row-buffer

* DIMM (Dual in-line memory module): multiple chips

  * DIMM appears as a single, higher capacity, wider interface DRAM module to the memory controller. Higher aggregate bandwidth, but minimum transfer granularity is now 64 bits

  * ![1568172437863](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568172437863.png)

  * Memory controller converts physical address to DRAM bank, row, column

  * Physical addresses are interleaved across DRAM chips at byte granularity

  * DRAM chips transmit frst 64 bits in parallel

  * > On the chip pictured, Kayvon noted that there are 8 DIMMs, and asked what the 9th would be if there were one more. To this, someone responded "ECC"
    >
    > ECC, or "[Error-correcting code memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory)," can be used to detect and possibly correct errors in the other 8 DIMMs. Think parity bit checks, or Hamming codes.
    >
    > For those familiar with hardware, bit errors are not to be ignored. They can occur because of hardware failure, or if your computer is being used in a non-ideal environment (e.g. in a nuclear power plant, [the ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station)).

  * > the physical addresses could be interleaved across DRAM chips with granularity larger than one byte. For example, we could put bytes 0-3 on DRAM 0, 4-7 on DRAM 1, etc. In that case, we would transmit a strided pattern of bytes over the bus each cycle (e.g. byte 0 from DRAM 0, byte 4 from DRAM 1, etc.), but that's okay, as long as we eventually obtain the whole cache line we want to load
    >
    > one possible optimization is to load first the specific word that the memory request asked for and return it so that the processor can begin working with it, while the rest of the cache line finishes loading in. Of course, this would require changes to the semantics of how cache lines are loaded and processors' expectations about them

## Parallel 3D graphics

* The visibility problem:

  * what pixels does the triangle overlap? (“coverage”)
  * what triangle is closest to the camera in each pixel? (“occlusion”)
  * what scene geometry is visible within each screen pixel?
    * What scene geometry projects into a screen pixel? (coverage)
    * Which geometry is visible from the camera at that pixel? (occlusion)
  * rays
    * What scene geometry is hit by a ray from a pixel through the pinhole? (coverage)
    * What object is the frst hit along that ray? (occlusion)

* The graphics pipeline

  * Geometry: compute vertex positions on screen
  * Rasterization: compute covered samples
  * Shading: compute color of colored pixels
  * Pixel Ops: depth test & depth/color write

* Coverage

  * $E_i(x, y) = (x - X_i)dY_i - (y - Y_i)d X_i = A_i x +B_i y +C$ (inside < 0 , on edge = 0, outside > 0)
  * $inside(sx, sy)$: three edges < 0
  * incremental updates: $dE_i(x + 1, y) = E_i(x, y) + A_i$
  * tiled triangle traversal: All modern GPUs have fixed-function hardware for efficiently performing data-parallel point-in-triangle tests
    * Simplicity of wide parallel execution overcomes cost of extra point-in-triangle tests (most triangles cover many samples, especially when super-sampling coverage)
    * Can skip sample testing work: use trianglebox test to classify entire block not in triangle (“early out test”), or entire block entirely within triangle (“early in”)

* Occlusion

  * depth-buffer (Z-buffer): For each coverage sample point, depth-buffer stores depth of closest triangle at this sample point that has been processed by the renderer so far

  * ```
    bool	pass_depth_test(d1,	d2)	{	
    			return	d1	<	d2;				
    }		
    depth_test(tri_d,	tri_color,	x,	y)	{	
    		if	(pass_depth_test(tri_d,	zbuffer[x][y])	{
    				//	triangle	is	closest	object	seen	so	far	at	this	
    				//	sample	point.	Update	depth	and	color	buffers.			
    				zbuffer[x][y]	=	tri_d;					//	update	zbuffer
    				color[x][y]	=	tri_color;			//	update	color	buffer
    		}
    }
    ```

  * Z-buffer algorithm has high bandwidth requirements
    - Number of Z-buffer reads/writes for a frame depends on:
    - Depth complexity of the scene: how many triangles cover each pixel on average
    - The order triangles are provided to the graphics pipeline (if depth test fails, don’t write to depth buffer or rgba) 

  * Z Depth buffer BW = Freq x MPixel per image x avg. scene depth complexity x Z bit

    * GPUs often sample coverage multiple times per pixel for quality: multiply by 4
    * Scene is often rendered multiple times per frame: multiply by 2-3

  * Modern GPUs have fxed-function hardware to implement caching and lossless compression of both color and depth buffers to reduce bandwidth

* Frame buffer compression

  * depth-buffer compression: reduce BW, lossless, for fixed-point numbers
    * screen tile based
    * On tile evict:
      1. Compute zmin/zmax (needed for hierarchical culling and/or compression)
      2. Attempt to compress
      3. Update tile table
      4. Store tile to memory
    * On tile load:
      1. Check tile table for compression scheme
      2. Load required bits from memory
      3. Decompress into tile cache
    * ![1568186073575](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568186073575.png)
  * Anchor encoding
    * Choose anchor value and compute DX, DY from adjacent pixels (fits a plane to the data)
    *  Use plane to predict depths at other pixels, store offset d from prediction at each pixel
    * Scheme (for 24-bit depth buffer)
      - Anchor: 24 bits (full resolution)
      - DX, DY: 15 bits
      - Per-sample offsets: 5 bits
  * Depth-offset compression
    * Assume depth values have low dynamic range relative to tile’s zmin and zmaz (assume two surfaces)
    * Store zmin/zmax
    * Store low-precision *8-12 bits) offset value for each sample
  * Explicit plane encoding: Do not attempt to infer prediction plane, just get the plane equation of the triangle directly from the rasterizer
    * Store plane equation in tile (high precision values)
    * Store bit per sample indicating coverage
  * Hierarchical occlusion culling "Hi-Z"
    * Z-Max culling: For each screen tile, compute farthest value in the depth buffer (often needed for compression): `z_max`
    * During traversal, for each tile:
      1. Compute closest point on triangle in tile: `tri_min`
      2. If `tri_min` >  `z_max`, then triangle is completely occluded in this tile. (The depth test will fail for all samples in the tile.) Proceed to next tile without performing coverage tests for individual samples in tile.
    * Z-min optimization: Depth-buffer also stores `z_min` for each tile. If `tri_max` < `z_min`, then all depth tests for fragments in tile will pass. (No need to perform depth test on individual fragments.)

  * Bandwidth scaling: sort is implemented as a broadcast
  * If tessellation is enabled, must communicate many more primitives than sort frst
  * Duplicated per triangle setup work across rasterizers

  * Partition screen into many small tiles (many more tiles than physical rasterizers)

  * After all geometry is bucketed, rasterizers process buckets in parallel
  * ![1568186867812](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\1568186867812.png)
  * Sort requires point-to-point traffic (assuming each triangle only touches a few buckets)
  * Good load balance
  * Potentially low bandwidth requirements

* Sort last fragment

  * Sort after fragment processing based on (x,y) position of fragment
  * No redundant geometry processing or in rasterizers (but z-cull is a problem)
  * Point-to-point communication during sort
  * Interleaved pixel mapping results in good workload balance for frame-buffer ops
  * Workload imbalance due to primitives of varying size
  * BW limit
  * Early Z cull is difficult

* Sort everywhere
