#### Streaming Multiprocessor

* unified graphics and computing multiprocessor that executes vertex, geometry, and pixel-fragment shader
  programs and parallel computing programs.

* 8 streaming processor cores

  * 8 scalar multiply-add unit (MAD)
  * 1.5GHz (GeForce 8800)
  * 36 GFlops per SM

* 2 special function units (SFU)

* 16KB read/write shared memory

  * graphics input buffers / shared data for parallel computing
  * by low-latency interconnect network between SPs & shared-mem banks

* vertex/geometry/pixel threads have indep. IO buffers

* use TPC texture unit as 3rd execution unit

* use SMC/ROP units to implement external memory load/store/atomic accesses

* SM Multithreading

  * graphics vertex of pixel shader is a program for a single thread that describes how to process a vertex or a pixel
  * a CUDA kernel is a C program for a single thread that describes how one thread computes a result  
  * the unified SM concurrently executes different thread programs and different types of shader programs
  * hardware multithreaded (up to 768 concurrent threads)
  * each SM thread has its own thread execution state and can execute an independent code path
  * synchronize at a barrier with a single SM instruction
  * lightweight thread creation
  * zero-overhead thread scheduling
  * fast barrier synchronization support

* Single-instruction Multiple-thread (SIMT)

  * SIMT multithreaded instruction unit create/manage/schedule/execute threads in groups of 32 parallel threads (warps. from weaving, 1st parallel-thread technology)
  * Each SM manages a pool of 24 warps, total 768 threads
  * individual threads $\to$ SIMT warps of same type, start together at the same program address
    * free to branch & execute independently
  * SIMT multithreaded instruction unit selects a warp that is ready to execute and issue the next instruction to that warp's active threads at inst. issue time
  * SIMT inst. broadcast synchronously to a warp's active parallel threads; individual threads can be inactive due to independent branching/predication
  * map warp threads to SP cores, each thread executes independently
  * full efficiency if all 32 threads of a warp take the same exec. path
    * diverge by data dependent conditional branch $\to$ serially execute each branch path taken, disabling threads that are not on that path
    * when all paths complete $\to$ all threads reconverge to the original execution path
  * branch synchronization stack to manage indep. threads that diverge & converge
    * branch divergence only occurs within a warp
    * different warps executes independently
  * ![image-20200222195518136](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\image-20200222195518136.png)
  * similar to SIMD
    * SIMT: 1 inst. to multiple independent threads in parallel (not multiple data lanes), control the execution & branching behavior
      * TLP, transparent to programmer, but substantial when considering performance (like cache line size)
    * SIMD: control vec. of multiple data lanes together, expose vector width to the software
      * DLP, software managed

* SIMT warp scheduling

  * warp scheduler operates at half the 1.5-GHz processor clock rate

  * At each cycle, it selects one of the 24 warps to execute a SIMT warp instruction 

  * An issued warp instruction executes as 2 sets of 16 threads over 4 processor cycles

    * [[Q: that's why half-warp is considered when measuring coalescing/divergent branching/bank conflicts?]]

    * 8 SP, pipelined, 4 stages (cycles) $\to$ 1 warp (32 threads for 1 instruction)

      * cycle1: issue half-warp to 8 SPs, execute 8 insts. (pre Fermi, Fermi has at least 32 SPs per SM)
      * cycle2; issue half-warp to 8 SPs, execute last 8
      * cycle 3-4, execute rest 16

    * > The stream processors are pipelined, so in fact many warps are in various stages of execution at any given time. The job of the scheduler on the multiprocessor is to grab warps that are not waiting on global memory reads and stuff them into the pipeline to begin executing their next instruction. Although a multiprocessor can *complete* an entire warp instruction (with some exceptions) every 4 clock cycles, it in fact takes many more than 4 clock cycles for a given warp instruction from beginning to end.

      > Every modern CPU works this way, except single-threaded code is much more likely to have "pipeline hazards", where the next instruction in the thread depends on the one before it in such a way that you can't stuff it into the pipeline next. By encouraging large numbers of independent instructions (i.e., threads don't usually talk to each other), a CUDA device can keep pipelines full without all the instruction reordering fanciness (and therefore transistor cost) of a CPU.

      > 1. The principal usage of "half-warp" was applied to CUDA processors prior to the Fermi generation (e.g. the "Tesla" or GT200 generation, and the original G80/G92 generation). [These GPUs were architected with a SM (streaming multiprocessor -- a HW block inside the GPU) that had fewer than 32 thread processors](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#architecture-1-x). The definition of warp was still the same, but the actual HW execution took place in "half-warps" at a time. Actually the granular details are more complicated than this, but suffice it to say that the execution model caused memory requests to be issued according to the needs of a half-warp, i.e. 16 threads within the warp. A full warp that hit a memory transaction would thus generate a total of 2 requests for that transaction.
      >
      >    [Fermi and newer GPUs have at least 32 thread processors per SM](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#compute-capability-2-x). Therefore a memory transaction is immediately visible across a full warp. As a result, memory requests are issued at the per-warp level, rather than per-half-warp. However, a full memory request can only retrieve 128 bytes at a time. Therefore, for data sizes larger than 32 bits per thread per transaction, the memory controller may still break the request down into a half-warp size.
      >
      >    My view is that, especially for a beginner, it's not necessary to have a detailed understanding of half-warp. It's generally sufficient to understand that it refers to a group of 16 threads executing together and it has implications for memory requests.

      > 2. Shared memory for example on the [Fermi-class GPUs](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#shared-memory-2-x) is broken into 32 banks. On [previous GPUs](http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#shared-memory-1-x) it was broken into 16 banks. Bank conflicts occur any time an individual bank is accessed by more than one thread in the same memory request (i.e. originating from the same code instruction). To avoid bank conflicts, basic strategies are very similar to the strategies for coalescing memory requests, eg. for global memory. On Fermi and newer GPUs, multiple threads can read the same *address* without causing a bank conflict, but in general the *definition* of a bank conflict is when multiple threads read from the same bank. For further understanding of shared memory and how to avoid bank conflicts, I would recommend the [NVIDIA webinar](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-computing-webinars) on [this topic](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/CUDA/training/sharedmemoryusage_july2011.mp4).

## Parallel Computing Architecture

* extensive data parallelismâ€”thousands of computations on independent data elements;
* modest task parallelismâ€”groups of threads execute the same program, and different groups can run different programs;
* intensive floating-point arithmetic; latency toleranceâ€”performance is the amount of work completed in a given time;
* streaming data flowâ€”requires high memory bandwidth with relatively little data reuse;
* modest inter-thread synchronization and communicationâ€”graphics threads do not communicate, and parallel computing applications require limited synchronization and communication.  



### Data-parallel Problem Decomposition

* ![image-20200223011823502](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\image-20200223011823502.png)

  * CTA: computes result blocks selected by its CTA ID
  * grid: computes many result blocks, and sequential grids compute sequentially dependent application steps
  * higher: multiple GPU per GPU/cluters of multi-GPUs

  * local: each executing thread has a private per-thread local memory for register spill, stack frame, and addressable temporary variables  
  * shared: each executing CTA has a per-CTA shared memory for access to data shared by threads in the same CTA
  * global: sequential grids communicate and share large data sets in global memory
  * fast barrier synchronization instruction to wait for writes to shared or global memory to complete before reading data written by other threads in the CTA  
  * relaxed memory order
    * preserves the order of reads and writes to the same address 
      * from the same issuing thread
      * from the viewpoint of CTA threads coordinating with the barrier synchronization instruction

  * The key is decomposing the problem into independently computed blocks as described earlier. The GPU compute work distribution unit generates a stream of CTAs and distributes them to available
    SMs to compute each independent block. Scalable programs do not communicate among CTA blocks of the same grid; the same grid result is obtained if the CTAs execute in parallel on many cores, sequentially on one core, or partially in parallel on a few cores.

## Summary

- This paper describes a brand new GPU architecture that unifies the traditional vertex and pixel processors and extends for generalized SIMT computing with the CUDA programming model. In the old GPUs, the vertex and pixel-fragment processors are designed for different tasks and operations. Tesla architecture solves the problem by providing a unification enabling dynamic load balancing and sharing of expensive hardware.

## Methods & Results

- Tesla architecture unifies the vertex and pixel-fragment processors by scalable processor array. The program commands are processed at the frontend (host interface, assembler, work distribution units), and all computations are done on the same multi-level processing units (Texture/Processor Clusters, Streaming Multiprocessors, Streaming Processors). All computation units are interconnected by a single PCI-Express bus. Streaming multiprocessors dispatch instructions in the single-instruction multiple thread (SIMT) fashions, combining threads into warps that execute the same instruction. Compilers can convert DX10 vector or PTX scalar instructions to Tesla SM register-based instructions, which contain FP, INT, transcendental, interpolation, bitwise, control instructions. CUDA provides an extension to C programming language for programming GPU. The global work is split into thread blocks (cooperative thread array, CTA) which is an array of concurrent threads executing the same thread program. The thread blocks are divided into threads which computing result elements selected by its TID. Meanwhile, the memory consists corresponding levels: global memory for whole grids; shared memory for each thread block residing in the SM; local memory for each executing thread for register spilling, temporary variables, execution state. The experiment shows that GeForce GPUs/Quadro workstations can give 100X speedup on modular modeling, more than 200GFlops on n-body problems and real-time 3D magnetic resonance imaging.

## Personal Opinions

- For me, this is a solid paper providing so many details on how GPU implements. However, it lacks some performance results and implementation details. For example, how do the warp dispatching and SP pipeline implement? Why does the scoreboard algorithm fit the SIMT scheme (or is it the same as CDC 6600 scoreboard?). Also, it lacks some explanation on other details, like constant cache, cache hierarchy, PTX instruction mapping, scratchpad cache, shared memory banks, etc. Furthermore, SIMT architecture might not be able to handle task-based parallelism or dynamic scheduling programs. For example, for Barnes-Hut algorithms which utilize semi-static assignments or non-uniform working sets, the simple SIMT scheme can't work well. Actually, now GPU has dynamic parallel (at least for [NVIDIA](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/introduction-cuda-dynamic-parallelism/))
