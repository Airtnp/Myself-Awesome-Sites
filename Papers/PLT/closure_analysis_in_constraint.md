# Closure Analysis in Constraint Form

## Introduction

### Abstract

* flow analysis of untyped high-order functional programs presented, ..., usually defined as abstract interpretations
* used for different tasks, type recovery, globalization, binding-time analysis
* contain a global closure analysis that computes information about higher-order control-flow
  * correct with call-by-name/call-by-value, remained open for arbitrary beta-reduction (solved by this paper)
* closure information is still valid after beta-reduction
  * closure analysis $\to$ constraint system



### Background

* optimization of higher-order functional languages $\to$ powerful program analyses

* traditional framework: abstract interpretation

  * typed language: suitable abstract domains can often defined by induction on the structure of types

    * > function spaces can be abstracted into function spaces.   

    * ???

  * untyped (lambda-calculus, Scheme): abstract domains cannot be defined by abstracting function spces to function spces

* untyped program analysis: in the absence of types, define the abstract domains in terms of program points

* consider $\lambda$-term

  * $(\lambda x.\lambda y. y(x I)(x K)) \Delta$ where $I = \lambda a.a$, $K = \lambda b.\lambda c. b$, $\Delta = \lambda d.d d$
  * label variables
    * bound: $\lambda$
    * free: arbitrary label

* For every application point, which abstractions can be applied?

* For every abstraction, which argument can it be applied?

* Closure analysis: Higher-order analysis = first-order analysis + closure analysis

  * can be defined in abstract interpretations
    * abstract domain: programs to be analyzed
      * traditional: can analyze pieces of program in isolation
    * global: complete program is required before abstract domain defined
    * cannot take higher-order input (add program points)
  * flow analyses: analyses based on closure analysis
  * can handle dynamic & multiple inheritance (according to Similix, Schism, Agesen on Self)
  * set-based analysis using constraints: Heinitze
    * difference: avoid analyzing code that will not be executed under call-by-value



### Our Results

* closure analysis is correct w.r.t. arbitrary beta-reduction (any reduction strategy)
* subject-reduction result: closure info is still valid after $\beta$-reduction

* constraint system doesn't depend on labels being distinct: possible to analyze $\lambda$-term, $\beta$-reduce, analyzing results without relabeling
  * a direct proof of correctness of modified abstract interpreation more complicated than proof presented here.

### Example

* constraints $\to$ Horn clauses
  * `n` abstractions & `m` applications, $n + (2 \times m \times n)$ constraints
    * worst-case quadratic
* ![image-20200113220409301](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\image-20200113220409301.png)
* metavariables: $[[\mathcal{v}^l]], [[\lambda^l]], [[@_i]]$ as variables with label $l$, abstractions with label $l$, applications with label $i$
  * don't assume just one abstraction with label $l$, do closure analysis of all terms
* ![image-20200113222043198](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\image-20200113222043198.png)
* minimal solution is a mapping $L$
  * ![image-20200113222333243](D:\OneDrive\Pictures\Typora\image-20200113222333243.png)
  * the whole Î»-term will, if normalizing, evaluate to an abstraction with label 2 ($L[[@_4]] = \{2\}$)
  * at application point $@_3$, there can only be applied abstraction with label 2 ($L[[\mathcal{v}^1]] = \{2\}$)
  * the application point $@_3$ is the only point where abstractions with label 2 can be applied ($L[[\lambda^1]] = \{1\}$)
    * [[Q: ??? what does it matter with label 2]]
  * such abstractions can only be applied to $\lambda$-terms that either do not normalize / evaluate to an abstraction with label 2 ($L[[\mathcal{v}^2]] = \{2\}$)
